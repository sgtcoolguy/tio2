# Tio2 [![Appcelerator Titanium](http://www-static.appcelerator.com/badges/titanium-git-badge-sq.png)](http://www.appcelerator.com/titanium/)

Titanium utility for better automated unit and functional testing of Titanium APIs and Titanium Apps.

This utility is meant to be run from the command-line against an existing Titanium app (either Alloy or Titanium classic).

It's meant to be non-invasive (i.e. doesn't write over your app.js, tiapp.xml, etc.) and non-confrontational (create artifacts that must be merged in git, etc).

## Current Status [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/tio2.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/tio2)

- support for iOS simulator and device testing
- support for Android simulator and device testing

## Requirements

* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) >= 0.10.13
* [Titanium CLI](https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium)
* [Titanium SDK](https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile)

## Install

#### from npm 

```
[sudo] npm install -g tio2
```

#### from github (cutting edge)

```bash
[sudo] npm install -g git://github.com/appcelerator/tio2.git
```

#### clone and install local

```bash
git clone https://github.com/appcelerator/tio2.git
cd tio2
npm install
sudo npm link
```

## Quick Start

Create a `specs` folder in your Titanium app (at the same level as the `Resources` folder).  The spec should be in mocha format.

For example, really simple spec file:

```javascript
describe("Ti.UI",function(){
    it("create empty view", function(){
        var view = new Ti.UI.createView();
        should(view).not.be.null;
    }); 
});
```

```bash
# run the built-in example
tio2 --platform ios ./example

# let's launch and run once
tio2 --platform ios /path/to/project

# let's launch and run 100 iterations
tio2 --platform ios --count 100 /path/to/project

# let's make it quiet (no logging)
tio2 --platform ios --quiet --count 100 /path/to/project

# let's filter for test specs that match a specific regular expression
tio2 --platform ios --grep "^foo" --count 100 /path/to/project

# let's launch and run on device for ios
tio2 --platform ios --target device /path/to/project

# let's launch and run on device for android
tio2 --platform android --target device /path/to/project
```

Notice that you do not need to require should or ti-mocha and you don't need to run the mocha test suite (using `mocha.run`).  This will be done automatically for you.

Example output will be in JSON with each test iteration as well as environmental information collected during the test:

```json
{
   "results": [
      {
         "state": "passed",
         "duration": 2119,
         "suite": "hello",
         "title": "test emptyview"
      },
      {
         "state": "passed",
         "duration": 1177,
         "suite": "hello",
         "title": "test basic view"
      },
      {
         "state": "passed",
         "duration": 1529,
         "suite": "hello",
         "title": "test basic window"
      },
      {
         "state": "passed",
         "duration": 3052,
         "suite": "hello",
         "title": "test basic windowopen/close"
      },
      {
         "state": "passed",
         "duration": 2930,
         "suite": "hello",
         "title": "test basic window with single view"
      }
   ],
   "platform": {
      "ostype": "32bit",
      "name": "iPhone OS",
      "osname": "iphone",
      "version": "7.1",
      "address": "99.9.9.9",
      "macaddress": "D5484924-CCBD-4901-9057-AED67992AFE9",
      "architecture": "x86_64",
      "availableMemory": 399.75390625,
      "manufacturer": "unknown",
      "model": "Simulator"
   },
   "displayCaps": {
      "density": "high",
      "dpi": 320,
      "platformHeight": 480,
      "platformWidth": 320
   },
   "build": {
      "date": "05/23/1416:33",
      "git": "baea217",
      "version": "3.3.0"
   },
   "date": "2014-05-28T17:49:44.564Z"
}
```

The duration of each test is in microseconds, which allows you to get more accurate timings of test iterations.

## Motivations

The original genesis of this project was to build a better tool that would allow us to capture performance data for each build.  We have a legacy set of performance tests that we run but they are manual and are brittle and don't provide the coverage that we need.  This started out as a prototype to be able to simply write "ti-mocha" unit tests that could serve as performance benchmarks.  However, after reviewing this, we thought this could be more broadly useful and could expand beyond
performance measurements.

## Limitations / TODO

- For Android, the emulator must already be running -- it does not currently auto-start it. 
- Currently, only JSON is output.  Will expand to provide integration with mocha reporters.
- Windows 8 (as part of Hyperloop + Ti.Next)


## Credits

Some great Titanium based utilities are leveraged to make this all work:

- [tiapp.xml](https://github.com/tonylukasavage/tiapp.xml)
- [ti-mocha](http://tonylukasavage.com/ti-mocha/)

Among other great open source libraries like [mocha](https://github.com/visionmedia/mocha), [should](https://github.com/visionmedia/should.js/), etc.

## The name?

TiO2 (Titanium + Oxygen) is the most important oxide, which exists in three important polymorphs; anatase, brookite, and rutile. Oxygen is vital to life on earth -- and so is testing to building great software.
